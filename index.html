    <p>I think an ideal job would be one to start my career off while still learning and just breaking into the IT job scene, this job require low end troubleshooting and technical support, I should have learned this content by the time i am finishing my bachelors and starting to look for jobs, I think it would be a good starting point to learn more and have time to explore other IT intrests.</p>
    
    <p>Personal Profile:</p>
    <p>Results with links to the pages to try the tests for yourself.</p>

    <p>Creativity test.</p>
    <a href=http://www.testmycreativity.com/><img src="creativity.jpg"></a>
    <p>The results show that I am an introvert but have a strong personality, I am proactive, and avidly pursue one's interests, I have the courage to express one's views, i can adapt well to see other point     of views in a team and can take the lead when necessary, I am a visual learner i like to watch and learn.</p>
    <p>Project Idea:</p>
    <p>Today my project idea is going to be an app, an app for gym programs so far the app will have at least two different styles of Fitness, one based on powerlifting for strength and the other based on bodybuilding for hypertrophy, but both will work well off percentages. I want to be able to make it so that you can just select a program style, put in the weights of your one rep maximum in Kilograms or pounds and then just hit a button, the next 6 weeks your gym program is laid out for you no thinking just results. 
</p>
    <p>My motivation for this idea comes from my own experiences in the gym, i've been through a lot of different programs some successful and some not so successful, i've gained enough knowledge through trial and error to be able to find out what works and what doesn't, I have had a fair few personal trainers some brilliant and some with no idea what they are doing, I want to be able to use the app for my own use but also be able to help other people. I have a team of friends and myself who will be able to trial the app to make certain that it works not only with the results but the software as well. </p>
    <p>The app will provide a simple and easy to use design where you can choose from two different programs at the moment could be more in the future where you can select the program One rep maximum of certain movements or exercises and then the app will take care of the percentages. There will be an in-depth tutorial section for every movement and exercise in the programs these will include text, image and videos with voice over so that way there should be enough information for everybody to learn and understand a certain movement or exercise, you will have the ability to choose and change between certain secondary movements and exercises these will mainly be isolation movements, these will be easy to choose options in a drop down menu. It will have a completion button that will confirm the completion or fail of the current exercise or movement once hit it will bring up the next feature which will be an automatic rest timer that is set for different times for the different exercises and programs if you do not complete a set or a rep this will also take that into account and alter the percentages for the next set or the next time you do that exercise once the timer is complete it will automatically bring up the next exercise or movement there will also be results tracking this will help you keep track of your progress. There will also be a feedback page where you can give feedback, request help and report any issues. 
</p>
    <p>The tools and technology needed for my idea will include the software of an app building platform and the hardware will include mobile phones both Android and apple, Myself and a few friends will have access to a few different gyms to trial the app and programs. </p>
    <p>I hope to require the skills needed to understand the software needed to write apps and also understand the software of the phones we will be using, I hope to gain this knowledge through my studies doing my Bachelors in information technology at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. </p>
    <p>If my project is successful I hope to launch it on the marketplace of the Google Play Store and also the apple Store for people to download, hopefully millions but at the very least me and my friends will have a good app that we can use in the gym and not pay for personal trainers or programs to be written by personal trainers.</p>
